# Hi there

Welcome to **Wonderland Wonders**' website!
Build with ExpressJS and EJS. Languages that mainly used are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS but here I don't use frameworks like Vue.js, REACT, etc. You can surely apply them into this app for a better performance.
This website is initially built for the official game of Soulcrave (SOC) 15. But no worry, you can of course see and learn every code in this project and I'll guide you from here.

## index.js
Here ExpressJS is used as its normal usage. You can start to use ExpressJS from [this guide](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html). For applying EJS you can read its guide [here](https://ejs.co/). Another libraries that I used are:<br/>- **Morgan**, to spectate the website's request and response, check [Morgan's Guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan).<br/>- **Mongoose**, to use mongoDB easily within JavaScript website. [Guide here](https://mongoosejs.com/).
